# devenv

just my development environment scripts.
to make it easier to sync my dev scripts between devices

i use synergy and termux on my phone.

this github project will help me easier write shell scripts for my phone.

i use my twitter account as commands stream.
if there word reminder. php script on my phone will parse it and set android reminder.
it has flexible and custom reminder rules that i create on the go.

also manages todo list. kinda list that can be public.
it's as expirement how much information i can share to public.
what kind of todos i can share publicly.

i use task warrior for task list.
and inspired by time warrior i written my own smaller time tracking php script. that acts like app over termux bash on phone.
also when some text copied to buffer on my phone it reads contents of buffer with tts voice.
it's possible to use voice for reminders. and make reminders really smart and customizable to myself.
depending on context, current project, my location, time of the day, how well rested i am.

i use nootropics, modafinil, pramiracetam, phenlylpiracetam, caffeine etc.
different drugs changes my ways of thinking so reminders can adapt to it.
if i get hyper focused on modafinil reminder may act in different way.

sometimes i mix scripts and languages. for example bash script that generates php script that generates and executes bash script. it's a form of entertainment for me. i may have idea of writting my own language or using something else like coffee script that compiles into php code.


i like idea of attaching some machine learning or it maybe fun to attach human processing units.
amazon turk in order to help my scripts logic to act more like human. but this part seems complicated at the moment.
i will not write all at once. it's a side project and i write it just for fun. in any direction.
if i feel like i need something i just write it in 10 minutes or so.

termux enables me to write things from my phone offline anywhere.
reminders should sync and have offline phone mode.

code maybe random quality. it's just hacking things for fun of it and making somewhat smart pc that adapts to my activities. kinda my external mind that thinks on it's own and completes my mind. it's a vision of project a dream.
in real expect lots of messy or even stupid scripts if you bother to read.
