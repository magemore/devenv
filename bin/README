problem
there bash functions
i switched to fish

on termux i still use bash...
and if i set path for bash
#!/bin/bash
than it will not work from termux
maybe rewrite everything as fish functions
on make fish wrappers to call it as
bash ~/mage/devenv/bin/some_bash_function

at the moment it's hard to rewrite some bash functions for fish
confused with fish if conditions and how to place argv inside quotes
