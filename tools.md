## termux
bin folder works in path and sync of scripts with github.
but !#/bin/php like scripts don't work on android
- [ ] rewrite this scripts with bash wrapper, as additional file... maybe only on mobile like this.
- best just wait and hope it gets resolved itself. it's termux problem
  - i don't need that much scripting on mobile at the moment
